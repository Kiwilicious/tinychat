A tiny chat (haha get it?) application built with HTML and CSS with jQuery handling most of the
functionality. As this was focused on front end development, the back end only consisted of a simple
node/express server with dummy data. Socket.IO was used to simulate simple user interaction.

# Setup
1. Run `npm i`
2. Run `npm start`
3. Go to `localhost:8080`
